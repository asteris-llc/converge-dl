## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Do These Things

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

#### Consideration

- Experience levels vary. Don't assume that someone can understand your
  particular explanation.
- Keep in mind that English is a second language for many users.
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences

#### Respect

- It is possible to strongly disagree without using harsh language or resorting
  to derogatory comments. If you disagree with someone, disagree with the
  argument, not the character of the person.
- If your work receives criticism, receive it with grace and&hellip;
- Remember that everyone is entitled to an opinion.
- Using welcoming and inclusive language in all your interactions.

#### Asking for help

- If you don't know how to proceed with an aspect of development or
  documentation, ask for help! Always read the documentation, but don't be
  afraid to ask "silly" questions.
- When asking for help, take advantage of the resources that are available to
  you, including the wiki, issue list, and Slack channel.

#### Responsibility

- If you did something wrong, apologize to the affected. Do your best to fix the
  issue and, if you can't, ask for help!
- Show empathy towards other community members.
- Focus on what is best for the community.

#### Attribution

- Give proper credit to everyone involved in any contribution to the project, be
  it documentation, tests, code, or anything in between.
- If someone fails to give adequate contribution, gently remind them while being
  considerate. Assume that the omission was accidental, not malicious.

### Explictly Unacceptable Behavior

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any
contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team
at [info@aster.is](mailto:info@aster.is). All complaints will be reviewed and
investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and
appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain
confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of
specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
